# Towers of Hanoi with Login

This is a school assignment I did part of application development class over two years. Every year I worked on it for two weeks.

Year 2020:
- actual game

Year 2021:
- login/register system
- increased responsiveness and scaling of the app
  

Features:
- a login/register system (unfortunately only reads/writes user info from/into files)
- password hashing with SHA-512 
- Towers of Hanoi game
